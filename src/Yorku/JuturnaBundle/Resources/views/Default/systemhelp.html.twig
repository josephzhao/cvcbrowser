        <div id="sh_1.1">
            <h2>1.1 Purpose</h2>
            <p>"Juturna" is a web-based geographic information system (web-GIS) that supports 
            the collection, analysis, data sharing and reporting of community collected water 
            quality data. It is currently implemented to support <a href="http://www.ecospark.ca/" target="_blank">EcoSpark's</a> 
            <a href="http://www.ecospark.ca/changingcurrents" target="_blank">"Changing Currents"</a> 
            program that links water quality monitoring to environmental and science curriculum 
            in schools. This project addresses requirements of data sharing and monitoring 
            specified in Annex 4 of the Canada-Ontario Agreement (COA).  It provides a collaborative 
            mechanism among researchers at York University, the <a href="http://www.trca.on.ca/" target="_blank">Toronto and Region Conservation 
            Authority</a> (TRCA) and the civil society organization <a href="http://www.ecospark.ca/" target="_blank">EcoSpark</a> (formerly Citizens' 
            Environment Watch (CEW)) to monitor environmental conditions of local watersheds.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="sh_1.2">
            <h2>1.2 Partners</h2>
            <p>Development and maintenance of the Juturna system is led by <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/bunchmj" target="_blank">Professor Martin Bunch</a> 
            out of the SpEAR lab at the <a href="http://www.fes.yorku.ca/" target="_blank">Faculty of Environmental Studies</a> at <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/">
            York University</a>, in support of <a href="http://www.ecospark.ca/" target="_blank">EcoSpark</a>'s <a href="http://www.ecospark.ca/changingcurrents" target="_blank">
            Changing Currents</a> program. This phase of the project is funded by the Ontario Ministry of Environment under the COA program.  
            The Juturna project has previously been supported by the Ontario Ministry of Environment and the 
            <a href="http://www.trca.on.ca/" target="_blank">Toronto and Region Conservation Authority</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="sh_1.3">
            <h2>1.3 History</h2>
            <p>Since the 1990s, environmental monitoring in Ontario has undergone drastic changes.  Environmentally-focused departments at 
            the provincial level continued to play a role in policy formation, but field work and ongoing sampling has been downloaded to 
            local regulatory agencies - the City of Toronto and the TRCA in the Toronto region. The TRCA continues to implement monitoring 
            programs either alone or by partnering. The <a href ="http://trca.on.ca/protect/monitoring/regional-watershed-monitoring-program/" target="_blank">
            Regional Watershed Monitoring Program</a> (RWMP) is one such initiative that supports decision-making and reporting requirements 
            to the Remedial Action Plan for Toronto, as well as for Municipal State of the Environment and TRCA Watershed Report Cards. The 
            RWMP is focused on six areas of monitoring for its nine watersheds: aquatic habitat and species, fluvial geomorphology, 
            terrestrial natural heritage, surface water quality, flow and precipitation, and ground water.</p>
            <p>The TRCA's interest in this project derives from the need to support such initiatives, and a need to "facilitate the exchange 
            of environmental monitoring data with program partners and the general public."  For example, in addition to collecting their 
            own data, the TRCA supports community-based water quality monitoring. To ensure high quality of community-collected data, the 
            TRCA (with the aid of CEW - now EcoSpark - as a community partner) developed monitoring protocols to use benthic macro-invertebrates 
            as a biotic indicator of ecosystem health. EcoSpark's interest stems from a desire to provide access to geospatial analysis and 
            visualization tools to the general public, so as to support public involvement in decision-making about environmental issues in 
            the Toronto region.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.yorku.ca/bunchmj" target="_blank">Professor Martin Bunch</a> at the <a href="http://www.fes.yorku.ca/">Faculty of Environmental Studies</a> 
            at <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/" target="_blank">York University</a>, <a href="http://www.trca.on.ca/">Toronto and Region Conservation Authority</a> 
            and <a href="http://www.ecospark.ca/" target="_blank">EcoSpark</a> (formerly CEW) have previously collaborated in a pilot project that demonstrated 
            'proof of concept' for web-GIS in support of data sharing and reporting of both expert and community-generated stream water quality data. 
            That pilot project explored the use of web-based GIS for information sharing among the TRCA and volunteers engaged in a community-based environmental 
            monitoring program to collect water quality indicators. The web-GIS system is known as 'Juturna' after the Roman goddess of wells 
            and springs. Juturna was further developed to provide capability of supporting information collection, analysis and sharing in 
            multiple watersheds (all watersheds within the TRCA jurisdiction) and to operate on an open-source platform (using Free and Open 
            Source Software).  This development was undertaken using User Centred Design and Iterative Development methods (requiring several 
            iterations in the development cycle).</p>
            <p>The intent of this project is to continue and move forward from a recent successful pilot project so as to further develop and 
            implement an internet-distributed geographic information system (web-GIS) infrastructure that will facilitate the reporting and 
            sharing of benthic macroinvertebrate indicators as well as water chemistry data, collected by volunteer monitors. Currently, 
            volunteer data is generated through EcoSpark's <a href="http://www.ecospark.ca/changingcurrents" target="_blank">Changing Currents</a> program 
            that links water quality monitoring to environmental 
            and science curriculum in schools.  The project is also intended to explore interoperability issues and data sharing 
            collaborations among local/project specific systems such as Juturna, and regional data coordination and sharing efforts such 
            as the University of Windsor's <a href="http://gems.uwindsor.ca/" target="_blank">Windsor-Essex Environmental Metadata System</a> (WEEMS). 
            Furthermore, the project will explore and 
            begin to implement mechanisms (both technical and organizational) to facilitate adoption of the Juturna web-based community 
            monitoring system by organizations having different spatial areas of interest (e.g., other Conservation Authorities and 
            environmental NGOs in the Great Lakes Basin).</p>

            <h2>1.4 Software and System Design</h2>
            <p>Juturna is a web-distributed geographic information system (web-GIS). It is composed of: (i) Free and Open Source System (FOSS) 
            code written for the Juturna project, (ii) FOSS software modules developed by others and linked together to form the overall Juturna 
            system and (iii) a Googlemaps mashup.  Juturna was developed using FOSS development tools.  (The only component that may potentially 
            be propriety is the spatial data required to delineate watershed and subwatershed boundaries).</p>

        <h1>2.0 The Juturna Interface</h1>
        <p>The Juturna interface consists of four main sections (<a href="#sh_fig_1">Figure 1</a> below): 1) the Header Bar, 2) the Map Viewer window, 3) the Watersheds Info panel, 
        and 4) the Detail Info Panel. A brief description of these components is provided below, and instructions on how to use the various functions accessible 
        via these interface components can be found in <a href="#sh_3.0">Section 3 (Accessing Juturna)</a>, <a href="#sh_4.0">Section 4 
        (Using Primary Juturna Interface Components)</a>, and <a href="#sh_5.0">Section 5 (Juturna Core Functions)</a>.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Figure 1</span>: Four main sections of the Juturna interface: 1) the Header Bar, 2) the Watersheds Info panel, 3) the Detail Info Panel, 
        and 4) the Map Viewer window.</p>
        <div id="sh_2.1">
            <h2>2.1 Header Bar</h2>
            <p>The Header Bar runs across the top of the Juturna interface, above the Watersheds Info panel, the Detail Info Panel and the Map Viewer (#1 in 
            <a href="#sh_fig_1">Figure 1</a>). On the left side of the Header Bar are the logos of the principle project partners. Clicking on these will open 
            a browser window that 
            loads the home page of these partners.  At the bottom of the Header Bar a strip extends across the Juturna interface.  This strip holds geographic 
            search and system help functions, a function to "add new Station" and a "group" tab that allows the user to search for stations by group. On the 
            right side you'll find the functions associated with logging into the Juturna system, retrieving a lost password, requesting a new account and 
            contacting the web master.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Header Bar is a stable component, but when a user is logged in the information at the right of the bar changes to display the 
            username of the currently logged-in user, a logout button and a function to change the user's password.</p>
            <p>Using the "Group" function: Left-click on the "Group" function to display water stations listed by School/Group in the Map Viewer. This is 
            a handy search tool for volunteers looking only for their own specific group. You may left-click on the link to any water station to bring up 
            "Site Details Information" in the map viewer. See <a href="#sh_4.5">4.5 "Using the Detail Info Panel"</a> (<a href="#sh_fig_8">Figure 8</a>).</p>

            to its right.  Selecting a monitoring station 
            from the list will select the station's icon in the Map Viewer (the icon will turn green) and bring up an information window linked to the icon.  
            In the <a href="#sh_2.3">Detail Info Panel</a>, information about the selected monitoring station and functions associated with managing its data will appear. 
            See <a href="#sh_4.3">"Using the Stations List"</a> below, for more information.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Watersheds List:</span> With the Watersheds List tab selected, the user is presented with an expandable/collapsible list of watersheds, 
            subwatersheds and monitoring stations (e.g., Watersheds > Don River Watershed> Lower Don Subwatershed > [List of Monitoring stations].  
            Similar to the Stations list, this panel is interactive with both the <a href="#sh_2.4">Map Viewer</a> and the <a href="#sh_2.3">Detail Info Panel</a> 
            to its right.  Selecting a monitoring station from the list will select the station's icon in the <a href="#sh_2.4">Map Viewer</a>

            See <a href="#sh_4.4">"Using the Watersheds List"</a> below, for more information.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">User Profile:</span>  With the User Profile tab selected, the user is presented with a list of only those monitoring stations which that user has 
            created.  For each monitoring station in the list, there will be a brief description of the monitoring station, and access to functions to select 
            the station, generate a water quality report, download data, edit data, upload pictures, and delete the station.  Use of these functions are the

            <p>The Detail Info Panel is located on the right side of the Juturna browser window, directly below the section of the Header Bar where the 
            functions associated with logging in to the Juturna system are displayed.  The Detail Info Panel is interactive with the Stations List/Watersheds 
            List.  When a monitoring station, watershed or subwatershed is selected in the Stations List/Watersheds List, the Detail Info Panel will present 
            a list of these entities, and provide access to functions to select a station, watershed or subwatershed, generate a monitoring report, edit data, 
            download data, and delete data.  See "Using the Detail Info Panel" below, for more information.</p>

            <h2>2.4 Map Viewer</h2>
            <p>The Map Viewer (#2 in <a href="#sh_fig_1">Figure 1</a>) is located immediately below the header bar in the middle of the Juturna interface, 
            between the Watersheds 
            Info panel and the Detail Info Panel.  This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)" target="_blank">googlemaps mashup</a> 
            that combines spatial data from <a href="http://maps.google.com/" target="_blank">maps.google.com</a> (satellite imagery, street maps, 
            etc.) with data provided by the Juturna system (e.g., watershed boundaries) and data entered by users (monitoring station locations and data stored 
            in the Juturna database).  The Map Viewer provides basic geographic information system (GIS) capability to pan, zoom in, zoom out, select an entity, 
            add data, turn on (view) or turn off various data layers, and access data management and reporting functions for water quality monitoring stations.  
            In the strip ranging across the top of the map viewer, you will find buttons to reset the Map Viewer window and turn the display of watershed 
            polygons on or off. (Some of this functionality operates in conjunction with other interface elements of the Juturna system).  See

        <h1>3.0 Accessing Juturna</h1>
        <div id="sh_3.1">
            <h2>3.1 Types of accounts</h2>
            <p>Many functions of the Juturna system can be accessed by the general public without needing a user account to log in to the system.  Only 
            data upload, data editing, and data deleting functions and account management require a user account.</p>  
            <p>There are two types of accounts in the Juturna Web-GIS system:  Volunteer accounts and Administrator accounts.  Volunteer accounts are 
            intended for users of the system who participate in community-based environmental monitoring (CBEM) programs that generate water chemistry 
            and benthic macroinvertebrate data to indicate stream health. Administrator accounts are intended for managers of CBEM programs that need 
            to administer the data generated (quality control), assign new accounts, remove monitoring stations, etc.</p>
            <!--This para needs to be checked for the profile tabs: is linking to 2.2 correct? -->  
            <p>Depending upon the type of account, a user may be provided with different information or system functions. For example, if logged 
            in as a Volunteer user, a "User Profile" tab will be presented in the Watersheds Info panel. If logged 
            in as an Administrator, the user will instead see a "System Administration" tab.</p>

            on the "Contact Webmaster" link in the upper right of the Juturna interface.</p>
            <!-- Does the link exist to contact webmaster? -->
            <p>Note that users of the Juturna Web-GIS system should be participants in a community-based environmental monitoring program, and have 
            been trained in the protocols used for data collection associated with that program.  Currently the Juturna system is designed to support 
            the <a href="http://www.ecospark.ca/changingcurrents" target="_blank">Changing Currents</a> program of the environmental NGO <a href="http://www.ecospark.ca/" target="_blank">
            EcoSpark</a>, and supports the benthic macroinvertebrate sampling protocol of the <a href="http://www.trca.on.ca/" target="_blank">Toronto 
            and Region Conservation Authority</a>, whose protocol is related to that of the 
            <a href="http://www.eman-rese.ca/eman/ecotools/protocols/freshwater/obbn/intro.html" target="_blank">Ontario Benthos Biomonitoring Network</a>.</p>

        <h1>5.0 Juturna Core Functions</h1>
        <p>The Juturna system is intended to support remote data entry of benthic macroinvertebrate and water chemistry data collected by volunteer water quality 
        monitors. To support this the Juturna system allows a user to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>create a record for a monitoring station composed of (a) a point location represented by an icon in the map viewer and (b) data records 
            in the database,
            </li>
            <li>upload data to the records associated with their monitoring station(s),
            </li>
            <li>edit/modify monitoring data that has previously been entered ,
            </li>
            <li>produce a report that includes a copy of monitoring data and an analysis of the benthic macroinvertebrate data that assesses the stream 
            health at the site of users' monitoring station.

            </li>
        </ul> 
        <div id="sh_5.1">
            <h2>5.1 Creating a monitoring station</h2>
            <p class="bold">When to create a new station:</p>
            <p>Create a new Station when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no Station located in the immediate area of the sampling site described on the data collection sheet.</li>
                <li>There is a unique and/or major feature or condition described and/or drawn on a data collection sheet, although the 
                site may be very close to an existing station nearby. For example, volunteers may routinely sample and re-sample a stream 
                segment immediately downstream of a storm water culvert or pipe.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>To create a monitoring station:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select “Add New Station” at the top of the Map Viewer.</li>
                <li>In the <a href="#sh_2.4">Map Viewer</a>, find the location where you established the water quality monitoring station (e.g., pan 
                and zoom using the map functions, or use the <a href="#sh_4.1">Location Search</a> function on the toolbar above the 
                <a href="#sh_2.4">Map Viewer</a>).
                </li> 
                <li>Once you have found the location of the monitoring site, left-click the map window at that location. The "Add New Station" 
                dialog box will appear.</li> 
                <li>Check that the location of the monitoring station is in the correct location (you may have to move the dialog box to see the icon). 
                If the icon is not in the correct location, click Cancel on the Add New Station dialog box (the icon will remain). Move the icon to the 
                exact location of your monitoring station: place the cursor over the icon - it will change to a hand with a pointing index finger - and 
                drag and drop the icon at the new location. Use the zoom in ( + ) and zoom out ( - ) buttons on the map window as needed. Once the icon 
                is placed the Add New Station window will re-appear.</li>
                <li>In the Add New Station dialog box, provide a name for your monitoring station, specify the nearest intersection and the municipality. 
                You may also provide other descriptive comments. Once you have entered this information click on "Submit". (The letter on the icon will 
                then change to N for new). 
                <li>Left click on the new station icon to add new site description, water chemistry and benthic macroinvertebrate data 
                (see <a href="#sh_5.2">Section 5.2 "Uploading Data"</a> below).</li>

            <h2>5.2 Uploading Data</h2>
            <p class="bold">When to add data to an existing Station:</p>
            <p>Add Data to an existing station when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sampling site described and/or drawn on a data collection sheet matches the general location and description of an existing Station in the 
                immediate vicinity. If you are unsure if the sampling sites are the same, click on and read the "Site Description" information in the data pane of 
                the existing Station. <span class="bold">Hint:</span> checking to see if the "Estimated Forest Cover" measurements match is a good way to tell if 
                the sampling sites are identical.</li>
                <li>The same location is sampled and re-sampled regularly, at different times of the year. If you are sure that an existing station is your 
                sampling site, enter your data there.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To upload data:</p>
            <p>Data upload functions may be called from the "Add New Data" links in the station information window in the <a href="#sh_2.4">Map Viewer</a>, 
            and in <a href="#sh_2.3">the Detail Info Panel</a> (in each case a monitoring station must be selected). This will bring up the data entry window 
            (<a href="#sh_fig_10">Figure 10</a>). The data entry dialog window will only display the category of monitoring station data that you have chosen 
            to add data to. The three categories of monitoring station data include: site description, benthic macroinvertebrate data(#1 in <a href="#sh_fig_10">Figure 10</a>), and water chemistry data.</p>
            <p>Each data entry window will present data entry boxes, text fields, radio buttons and drop down lists to facilitate data entry 
            (#2 in <a href="#sh_fig_10">Figure 10</a> displays the benthic macroinvertebrate data entry window). These boxes are designed to reflect the 
            <a href="http://www.ecospark.ca/sites/default/files/currents/field_manual.pdf" target="_blank">EcoSpark field data record sheets</a>. Once the user is satisfied 
            that they have completed their data entry task they will click on the "Submit" button in the bottom-right of the window.  Alternatively, they may use 
            the "Reset" or "Cancel" buttons to either set the window to its original condition or exit from the data entry window (#3 in <a href="#sh_fig_10">Figure 10</a>).
            (The Site Description data entry has multiple windows and users can use "Next" and "Prev" buttons to navigate among these before committing to submit 
            their data).</p> 
            <p>Once the data is submitted, the "[type of data] not yet submitted" message (#4 in <a href="#sh_fig_10">Figure 10</a>) will change to indicate that 
            the data was successfully written to the Juturna database. If the user changes data values after they have submitted data, they must click the submit 
            button again. This will overwrite the previously submitted data with the updated/edited data.</p>

            in the <a href="#sh_2.3">Detail Info Panel</a>. Doing so will call the data entry dialogs described in the <a href="#sh_5.2">data upload section</a> above. The process 
            for editing monitoring station data is exactly the same as described for <a href="#sh_5.2">uploading data</a>, except that the data entry dialog will be populated by the 
            stored data selected by the user. CAUTION: Submitting edited data will overwrite the original dataset.</p>

        <div id="sh_5.4">
            <h2>5.4 Producing a Monitoring Station Report</h2>
            <p>Monitoring station reports may be called by the "Report" links in the Detail Info Panel (#2 in both <a href="#sh_fig_8">Figure 8</a> and 
            <a href="#sh_fig_9">Figure 9</a>) and the "Generate Stream Health Report" in a monitoring station's information window in the 
            <a href="#sh_2.4">Map Viewer</a> (#7 in <a href="#sh_fig_2">Figure 2</a>). A monitoring station must be selected to do so. When a report is produced 
            for all three data categories, a dialog box (<a href="#sh_fig_11">Figure 11</a>) is called that requires the user to choose the date of the dataset 
            being reported (there may be multiple datasets associated with a single monitoring station).</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Figure 11:</span> A user must select the dates of the datasets to report. Only one date per data category may be selected.</p>
            <p>A full report includes all of the site description, benthic macroinvertebrate, and water chemistry data for the selected datasets.  It also includes 
            maps of the location of the monitoring station and an analysis of the benthic macroinvertebrate data, with assessments based on several stream health 
            indicators and an overall assessment of stream health that combines these indices (<a href="#sh_fig_12">Figure 12</a>).  Reports are produced in .pdf format and can be printed 
            or saved by users.</p>
